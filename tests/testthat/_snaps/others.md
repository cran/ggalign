# `layer_order()` works well

    `layer` must be a `geom_*()` object

---

    `order` must be a number, not the string "a".

---

    `order` must be a number, not `NA`.

---

    Can't convert from `order` <double> to <integer> due to loss of precision.

# geom_draw2() workds well

    Problem while computing aesthetics.
    i Error occurred in the 1st layer.
    Caused by error in `scale_f()`:
    ! You must provide `scale_draw_manual()` to use `geom_draw2()`
